# ☯ YinYang Deception Engine

**Karma-aligned deception infrastructure for symbolic AI behavior control.**

The YinYang Deception Engine is a backend-only cybersecurity system designed to replace traditional authentication and access logic with symbolic traps, entropy-based evaluation, and karmic behavior mapping.

## 🔮 Core Philosophy

This project is not just code — it’s an **infrastructure layer for ethical AI civilization**.  
By fusing symbolic computation with karmic traps, it creates a logic system where:
- **Entropy** ≈ risk
- **Traps** ≈ consequence
- **Karma** ≈ behavioral memory
